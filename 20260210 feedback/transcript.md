0:01
Okay. Hey, Silvin, how are you today?
0:04
Uh, so responding to the work, I'm super
0:08
impressed of how,
0:10
you know, the software,
0:13
you know, kind of puts the spreadsheet
0:17
on a website. I mean, that's fantastic.
0:19
Just to see that is like I mean, it's
0:20
like so elementary, but just to see that
0:22
is like super encouraging.
0:25
But the calculator is not calculating.
0:26
it's not properly querying the
0:29
spreadsheet neither on the fixed or the
0:31
variable. Uh so if that could work, I
0:34
mean I'm super encouraged by what we've
0:35
done, but I'd love to see this thing
0:38
actually work because again my
0:42
concept here is let someone just Oh,
0:46
this is in my way. Let someone just
0:48
drive this drive this until their their
0:52
heart's content. Right? So, for example,
0:56
here's a 35year-old.
0:59
And again, the state doesn't matter now.
1:01
This doesn't matter, but let's put in I
1:04
put in a crazy amount to prove it's not
1:06
working. Here's $525,000.
1:09
It gives a future value of 161344
1:13
on this Delaware Life Apex Control.
1:16
Let's put in 750. Just change the amount
1:19
so that that the math has to change.
1:22
161344.
1:24
I mean, the math isn't changing.
1:27
I don't know what would change the math.
1:30
Maybe this is
1:35
okay. So, 525
1:38
1 2 3 some crazy amount where we can't
1:40
mistake the math. No, just not I don't
1:43
know what the variable is, right? It's
1:44
just not obviously it's not working. I
1:46
don't know what the variable is. And I
1:48
promise on the variable annuity, I've
1:52
messed with this a few times. It's not
1:54
working as well. So 55y old withdrawal
1:59
at 62,
2:01
$400,000. I just put in some silly
2:03
amounts, so the math is hard for us, but
2:05
easy for the computer. And let's see.
2:08
It gives the accurate 7-year freeze, but
2:12
protective
2:14
the benefit base of 786
2:18
and a payment of 7817.
2:21
7086
2:22
and 7817 on protective secure pay. Let's
2:27
look for
2:29
secure pay. Lincoln
2:32
prosperity. H lot of a lot of secure
2:35
people out there. Oh, where's
2:40
protective
2:45
secure pay standard. What were we
2:47
working with? There's so many things.
2:50
Secure pay advance three-year. Well,
2:53
that would be a more unique term to
2:55
query
2:59
advance
3:01
advance threeear. So
3:05
this calculator, let's get the variables
3:07
the same. 5562
3:11
and I did
3:15
400
3:22
57 808. See that 5788
3:26
where this thing's at
3:28
70,817.
3:31
What's the benefit base? There's a lot
3:33
of columns here. Alt OCU.
3:36
Where's that benefit base
3:38
column?
3:41
A 624 benefit base where that thing had
3:45
a uh
3:47
786 benefit base. Somehow it's just not
3:49
it's just not querying properly.
3:52
56160
3:56
70,000.
3:58
Yeah, it's just not Let me see if
3:59
there's another column here. Is it
4:01
picking up just the wrong column?
4:03
Um, I can't tell. It's just not working
4:06
prop. It's It's It's clearly not working
4:07
properly. Let's just do one other kind
4:09
of proof of concept. Let's make it
4:12
age uh 60 and 65.
4:20
65
4:21
on 525. 1 2 3. So that that'll change
4:26
this to a five-year
4:29
hold period with a different amount. And
4:32
let's look at
4:34
so uh the first one. Bright house flex
4:37
choice level.
4:40
I should hide all those columns again.
4:42
It's BCNS.
4:45
So
4:49
annual lifetime income amount. Yeah. See
4:53
it's it's this column S column S 42883.
4:58
So we had a 6065
5:01
and what's the benefit base? That's the
5:03
other important number here that we'll
5:04
show at some point. Benefit base of 670
5:08
lifetime income 42883.
5:11
All right. 670 42883.
5:18
Let's do
5:21
60
5:23
65. And I did
5:30
525.
5:32
Calculate. Oh, let's make sure I I did
5:35
do that right. Right.
5:39
60 65 525.
5:42
and Bright House was
5:46
670 and 42883.
5:49
And that was the Bright House. There's
5:50
all these things. Bright house
5:53
uh flex choice level.
5:57
So get quote. Let's find Bright
6:02
Flex Choice.
6:05
Bright house flex choice level. This is
6:07
showing an 855.
6:11
me move me.
6:13
So 855 and 54. 855
6:18
and 54, right? 855 and 54 where the
6:23
calculator has the 670 and
6:28
670 and 42. So even if the calculator's
6:31
wrong, uh the website's just not
6:34
properly querying, right? And so if you
6:37
can just agree with me on I just want to
6:40
make sure you're seeing that the way I
6:41
see it. Um
6:47
stop sharing screen.
6:50
So I I should be back. Just if you can
6:52
you know verify what I'm saying like if
6:54
I'm using this right. I mean I think I
6:56
am. Uh somehow it's not querying right.
6:58
So it would be nice to see that work. I
7:00
just again the proof of concept here is
7:02
that once we have real data someone can
7:05
just use this calculator until their
7:07
heart is content and then the human
7:10
comes in right so if you can make the
7:13
calculator work that would be super
7:15
helpful but otherwise I'm so happy that
7:17
just you can see the export on a website
7:21
that's just brilliant um so uh let me
7:23
know your thoughts circle back and uh
7:25
I'll I'll hang tight to to to hear from
7:28
you thank
